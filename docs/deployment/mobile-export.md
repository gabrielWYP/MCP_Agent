# Mobile export of the student detector

This guide covers exporting the RGB-only `StudentModel` (plain or KD) to an FP32 LiteRT `.tflite` file, checking it against PyTorch, and what the Android app has to implement around it.

## 1. Set up the export venv (one time)

The export toolchain gets its own venv. `litert-torch` (the renamed `ai-edge-torch`) pins its own torch range, and the training venv must stay untouched.

```bash
uv venv .venv-export --python 3.12
uv pip install --python .venv-export/bin/python \
    --index-strategy unsafe-best-match -r requirements-export.txt
```

Everything runs on CPU. Prefix the commands below with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""`.

## 2. Export

```bash
.venv-export/bin/python scripts/export_student.py \
    --checkpoint <path>/best_model.pt --out-dir exports \
    --verify --data-root data
```

- **Checkpoints:** the script accepts plain-student or KD checkpoints (`model_state_dict`) and raw state_dicts. It strips legacy `kd_proj_*` keys, then loads everything else with `strict=True`. It rejects teacher checkpoints.
- **Outputs:** `exports/student_fp32.tflite` (git-ignored) and the sidecar `exports/student_fp32.json`. The sidecar is the app's contract: input, preprocessing, outputs, anchors, decode and NMS settings, the source checkpoint's sha256, and tool versions.
- **Smoke test:** `--random-init` exports an untrained student to test the pipeline.
- **Precision:** `--precision` only accepts `fp32`. It is where FP16 and INT8 will be added.

## 3. Verify

`--verify` runs the parity check after the export. To run it on its own:

```bash
.venv-export/bin/python scripts/check_export_parity.py \
    --model exports/student_fp32.tflite --data-root data --split val --num-images 20
```

The check sends the same preprocessed images through the PyTorch wrapper and the LiteRT interpreter, then compares the results in two ways:

- **Raw outputs:** the max abs diff of each output must be below `1e-3`.
- **Detections:** both sets of outputs are decoded with the reference decode and NMS. Boxes are matched when they have the same class and IoU ≥ 0.9. At least 99% must match.

The script exits with status 1 if either check fails.

## 4. Model contract

| | |
|---|---|
| Input | `(1, 640, 640, 3)` float32, **NHWC**, RGB |
| Output `boxes_raw` | `(1, 8400, 4)` float32: `dx, dy, log_w, log_h` |
| Output `cls_logits` | `(1, 8400, 2)` float32: logits for `mango`, `damage` |
| Anchors | stride 8 (80×80, offset 0), 16 (40×40, offset 6400), 32 (20×20, offset 8000). Row-major within a level. |

- **Signature names:** `args_0` is the input, `output_0` is `boxes_raw` and `output_1` is `cls_logits`. The exact names are recorded in the sidecar.
- **NHWC input:** LiteRT's native layout and the order Android reads bitmaps in. `litert_torch.to_channel_last_io` only adds one transpose at the input.
- **Two outputs:** boxes and class logits have very different value ranges. Keeping them apart lets INT8 give each output its own quantization scale.
- **Nothing after the head:** no exp, sigmoid, decode or NMS in the graph. exp and NMS quantize badly, so they run in the app.
- **Ops:** the converted graph uses only builtin ops (CONV_2D, LOGISTIC, MUL, ADD, CONCATENATION, SLICE, TRANSPOSE, RESHAPE, PAD, MAX_POOL_2D, RESIZE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR). It has no Flex or custom ops.

## 5. What the app must implement

The Python reference for each step is in `src/export/reference.py`. The decode step delegates to `src/training/decode.py`, the same decode used for training evaluation.

1. **Preprocess.** This is the same as `YOLODataset`'s val/test path.
   - `scale = 640 / max(w, h)`.
   - Resize bilinearly to `(floor(w·scale), floor(h·scale))`.
   - Paste the result centered on a 640×640 canvas filled with **114**. `pad_x = (640 − new_w) // 2` and `pad_y = (640 − new_h) // 2`.
   - Per channel, compute `(v / 255 − mean) / std`, with ImageNet `mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and `std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`.
   - The model does not normalize internally.
2. **Decode.** For anchor `i` in level `(stride, grid_w, offset)`:
   - `gy = (i − offset) / grid_w` and `gx = (i − offset) % grid_w`.
   - `cx = (gx + 0.5)·stride + dx` and `cy = (gy + 0.5)·stride + dy`. `dx` and `dy` are in pixels and are **not** multiplied by the stride.
   - `w = exp(log_w)` and `h = exp(log_h)`, also in pixels.
   - `score_c = sigmoid(logit_c)`.
   - Emit one candidate per (anchor, class) with `score > 0.25`. This is the per-class rule, not argmax.
3. **NMS.** Run greedy NMS per class on xyxy boxes with IoU threshold **0.5**, highest score first. Keep at most **300** detections.
4. **Map back to the original image.** `x = (x − pad_x) / scale` and `y = (y − pad_y) / scale`, then clip to the image.

The thresholds come from the checkpoint's training config and are recorded in the sidecar's `decode` section. The app should read them from the sidecar rather than hard-coding them.

## 6. Next steps

- **INT8 PTQ.** Use `ai-edge-quantizer`, which is already installed with litert-torch. Calibrate on about 100–200 letterboxed **train** images. Re-run the parity check with a looser, INT8-specific tolerance and compare mAP on val/test against FP32 with `scripts/evaluate_checkpoint.py`. Keep the float input and outputs at first, or quantize the I/O and record the scale and zero-point in the sidecar.
- **FP16.** An FP16-weight variant is about half the size. It is the natural format for GPU delegates.
- **On-device benchmark.** Run LiteRT's `benchmark_model` over `adb` on the target phone:

  ```bash
  adb push exports/student_fp32.tflite /data/local/tmp/
  adb shell /data/local/tmp/benchmark_model \
      --graph=/data/local/tmp/student_fp32.tflite --num_threads=4 \
      [--use_gpu=true | --use_nnapi=true]
  ```

  Report latency (ms), FPS and peak memory per delegate. Measure end-to-end latency, including preprocessing, decode and NMS, separately in the app.
