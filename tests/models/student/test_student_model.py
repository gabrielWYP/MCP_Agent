"""
Integration tests for StudentModel — full pipeline validation.

Verifies:
- 7-key forward pass output with correct shapes per spec contract
- Projection compatibility: all distill channels match ProjectionLayers defaults
- Parameter count ~3.2M (within 2.7M–3.7M range)
- Forward pass runs without error on CPU

Run with:
    python -m pytest tests/models/student/test_student_model.py -v
Or as script:
    python -m tests.models.student.test_student_model
