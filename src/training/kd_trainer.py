"""
Knowledge Distillation Trainer — subclass of Trainer with frozen teacher.

Extends the base Trainer with:
    - Frozen MasterModel teacher loaded from checkpoint
    - 4 trainable student → teacher adapter groups (`self.kd_adapters`,
      FitNets-style 1x1 regressors) owned by the trainer, NOT the student
    - Overridden _train_epoch with KD forward pass
      (student → adapter → MSE against frozen teacher features)
    - Inherited _validate (student-only), fit, checkpoint, early stopping

Teacher is stored as a plain attribute (NOT nn.Module submodule) so it is
naturally excluded from optimizer.param_groups and model.state_dict().

The adapters are kept out of `self.model` on purpose: they are training-only,
so the student's `model_state_dict` stays loadable into a bare
`StudentModel` (RGB-only inference/export never sees them). They reach the
optimizer through `_auxiliary_param_groups` and the checkpoint through
`_auxiliary_checkpoint_state` (key `kd_adapters_state_dict`).

History: the adapters used to map TEACHER → student channels, were attached
to the student as `kd_proj_*` submodules, and ran inside the teacher's
`torch.no_grad()` block. They were in the optimizer but never received a
gradient, so they stayed at random init for the whole run. Merely moving
them out of `no_grad` would not be enough: a trainable projection on the
teacher side can shrink the regression target itself (trivial collapse).

        D-G (fusion-redesign), mirrored from `Trainer._train_epoch`: this
        method used to catch OOM and NaN/Inf, print a warning, and
        `continue` — before the batch counter incremented — then floor the
        loss divisor at `max(n_batches, 1)`. An epoch where every batch
        failed therefore completed with finite-looking averaged losses,
        indistinguishable from a clean run, with zero coverage in `tests/`
        to catch it. Same policy as `loop.py`, so a reader does not have to
        learn two sets of rules:

        - `oom_skipped`: tolerated on epoch 1 only (allocator warm-up);
          raises immediately from epoch 2 onward.
        - `nan_skipped`: always counted, never itself fatal.
        - `steps_taken`: optimizer steps actually executed; zero in any
          epoch is always fatal, regardless of cause.

        Divergence from `loop.py`, stated explicitly: `KDTrainer` has no
        gradient accumulation (`grad_accum_steps` is not part of its
        structure and adding it is out of scope for this fix), so
        `steps_taken` here is simply "successful micro-batches" — one
        optimizer step per successful batch, as it always was for this
        trainer. There is no separate micro-batch/effective-step split to
