"""
Knowledge Distillation loss — per-level weighted MSE.

Computes MSE between projected teacher features and student features
at four distillation levels: backbone, fpn, head_cls, head_reg.

Each level contains a list of tensors (one per sub-level / scale).
The loss averages MSE across all sub-levels within each group,
then computes a weighted sum across groups.

Loss formula:
    kd_loss = Σ(level_weight × mean(MSE per sub-level))
