class TrainingConfig:
    """Configuration for MasterModel 2-phase training.

    Attributes:
        rgb_dir: Path to RGB images directory.
        nir_dir: Path to NIR images directory.
        labels_dir: Path to YOLO label files root (contains train/, val/).
        output_dir: Where to save checkpoints and logs.
        split_manifest: Path to the split manifest (splits.json) used to
            fail-fast if a split's directory contents diverge from it. Set to
            None to skip this guard (e.g., synthetic/unsplit test fixtures).
        backbone_variant: ConvNeXt variant ("tiny" or "small").
        num_classes: Number of detection classes.
        image_size: Input image size (square).
        letterbox_value: Padding pixel value for letterbox.
        batch_size: Training batch size.
        epochs_phase1: Epochs for Phase 1 (frozen backbone).
        epochs_phase2: Epochs for Phase 2 (partial unfreeze).
        lr_phase1: Learning rate for Phase 1.
        lr_phase2: Learning rate for Phase 2.
        weight_decay: AdamW weight decay.
        box_weight: Regression loss weight.
        cls_weight: Classification loss weight.
        class_weights: Per-class BCE weights [mango, danado].
        warmup_epochs: Linear warmup epochs per phase.
        patience: Early stopping patience (epochs without mAP improvement).
        log_interval: Steps between TensorBoard logs.
        save_interval: Epochs between periodic checkpoints.
        precision: One of "fp32" | "fp16" | "bf16". Replaces the old
            `amp: bool = True` flag, which silently enabled fp16 in any
            config omitting the key. Defaults to "fp32". "bf16" requires an
            Ampere-or-newer CUDA device and is validated at load time.
        grad_clip: Gradient clipping max norm.
        num_workers: DataLoader workers.
        nir_mean: NIR channel normalization mean.
        nir_std: NIR channel normalization std.
        seed: Random seed.
        device: "auto" | "cuda" | "cpu" | an explicit `torch.device` string
            (e.g. "cuda:0"). "auto" resolves to CUDA if available, else CPU
            — the same expression the trainer used to hardcode.
        pin_memory: DataLoader `pin_memory`. A machine-profile key (D-H).
        effective_batch: The experimental constant. Physical `batch_size` is
            a memory knob; `effective_batch` is what every run must match
            for results to be comparable (alongside `experiment_sha256`).
            `grad_accum_steps = effective_batch // batch_size` is always
            derived, never itself a config field.
        in_channels: MasterModel backbone stem input channels. 4 (default)
            for the early-fused RGB+NIR input; 3 for the RGB-only H-D
            control arm (fusion-redesign). Ignored for model_type="student".
        head_strides: MasterModel FPN/head pyramid strides, finest-first.
            Default `[4, 8, 16, 32]` includes the reconnected P2 level
            (fusion-redesign D-3). The single source of truth for
            `FPNNeck.emit_levels`, `YOLODetectionHead`'s level count,
            `YOLOv8Loss.strides`, and `decode_detections(strides=...)` — see
            `src/training/strides.py`. Ignored for model_type="student"
            (the student backbone is unaffected by this redesign and always
            uses 3 fixed levels at `[8, 16, 32]`).
        schedule: "two_phase" | "end_to_end". MasterModel training schedule
            (fusion-redesign D-4). "end_to_end" (default) trains every
            backbone stage, the stem, the neck and the head from epoch 0,
            with pretrained stages at `backbone_lr_mult` times the
            neck/head learning rate. "two_phase" preserves the previous
            frozen-then-partially-unfrozen schedule for configs that
            explicitly opt back into it (e.g. `training_mango.yaml`).
            Ignored for model_type="student" (always single-phase).
        backbone_lr_mult: Discriminative LR multiplier applied to pretrained
            backbone-stage parameters under `schedule="end_to_end"`. The
            stem is intentionally NOT in this group — it is 4-channel and
            out of ImageNet distribution by construction, so it trains at
            the full (non-discriminated) rate alongside the neck and head.
