"""
FPN necks for the two `MasterModel` fusion modes.

- `FPNNeck` — `fusion_mode="early"` (default). One `SingleFPN` over the
  single early-fused backbone stream, emitting the levels named by
  `head_strides`.
- `DualFPN` — `fusion_mode="cross_attention"`. Two `SingleFPN`s (one per
  modality) fused per level via a 1x1 conv, emitting the levels named by
  `emit_strides`.

fusion-redesign (design.md D-D) originally deleted `DualFPN`: with only one
backbone stream there is only one FPN. It is restored here for the
cross-attention path alone — its module names are part of the two-stream
checkpoint schema, and its default `fusion_convs` count still is.

`SingleFPN` is shared by both and kept unchanged — it already builds the
full [P2, P3, P4, P5] pyramid. `DualFPN` used to compute P2 in both of its
internal FPNs and discard both copies before fusion (`fused_features[0].grad
is None`, verified in proposal.md D3). It no longer has to: `emit_strides`
decides which of the computed levels are fused and returned, so the P2 both
streams already pay for can reach the head and the loss.

`FPNNeck` reconnects P2 by default: it wraps
`SingleFPN` and emits exactly the levels named by the configured
`head_strides`, finest-first. Every level `FPNNeck` returns is consumed
downstream by `YOLODetectionHead`, so — unlike the old design — no computed
pyramid level is discarded without a gradient path to the loss.

Output channels: 256 per level (unchanged).

    Two parallel FPNs (one per modality) with per-level fusion —
    `fusion_mode="cross_attention"` only.

    Fusion strategy: concatenate along channel dim → 1x1 conv → out_channels.
    This is lightweight (1x1 conv) but fully learnable, letting the model
    decide how to weight RGB vs NIR information at each pyramid level.

    The emitted pyramid is configurable, not fixed at 3 levels: `DualFPN`
    emits exactly the levels named by `emit_strides`, finest-first, and owns
    exactly `len(emit_strides)` `fusion_convs` — the count always equals the
    number of emitted levels, so a level can never be fused without a conv
    or built without a consumer.

    Two pyramids are supported
    (`src.training.strides.CROSS_ATTENTION_SUPPORTED_HEAD_STRIDES`):

    - `(8, 16, 32)` — the default and the pre-redesign two-stream
      checkpoint schema. Both internal FPNs still compute P2 and both copies
      are discarded before fusion.
    - `(4, 8, 16, 32)` — P2 is fused and emitted, so the finest level
      reaches the head and receives gradient instead of being computed twice
      and thrown away.

    Levels are selected by stride (`select_by_strides`), never by a
    positional slice: a mismatch between the requested pyramid and the
    computed one raises instead of surfacing as a `zip` that silently
    truncates. `MasterModel` still rejects any `emit_strides` outside the
    supported pair before construction is reached.
