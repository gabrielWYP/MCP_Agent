"""
Master Model — Full architecture for multimodal mango damage detection.

Input:  RGB image (N, 3, H, W) + NIR image (N, 1, H, W)
Output: YOLO-style detections + intermediate features for knowledge distillation

Two mutually exclusive fusion architectures, selected by `fusion_mode`
(`src/training/fusion_modes.py`). `forward(rgb, nir)` and the 7-key output
dict are identical in both, so `dataset.py`, `Trainer._train_epoch` and
`KDTrainer` need no call-site branch.

`fusion_mode="early"` (default) — simple early fusion. RGB and NIR are
stacked into one 4-channel tensor and fed through a single-stream backbone;
no cross-modal attention module, no second FPN:

    RGB + NIR
        ↓ cat(dim=1)
    EarlyFusionBackbone (single stem, single stage stack)
        ↓
    [S1..S4] — 4 stage features
        ↓
    FPNNeck ( SingleFPN )
        ↓
    pyramid — levels named by `head_strides`, default [P2, P3, P4, P5]
        ↓
    YOLODetectionHead (anchor-free, decoupled)

`fusion_mode="cross_attention"` — the pre-redesign two-stream architecture,
restored as a selectable mode (not a revert):

    RGB, NIR
        ↓
    DualConvNeXtBackbone (two stems, shared stages)
        ↓
    [rgb S1..S4], [nir S1..S4]
        ↓
    CrossModalFusion (per-stage cross-attention, RGB queries NIR)
        ↓
    [F1..F4], [nir S1..S4]
        ↓
    DualFPN (two FPNs + per-level fusion)
        ↓
    pyramid [P3, P4, P5] — `head_strides` is fixed at (8, 16, 32) here
        ↓
    YOLODetectionHead (anchor-free, decoupled)

Distillation outputs exposed (same 4 keys in both modes):
    - distill_backbone:  early → [S1..S4] from the single stream;
                         cross_attention → [F1..F4], the cross-attention
                         fused features. Both are the 4-stage,
                         [96, 192, 384, 768]-channel feature set that
                         carries BOTH modalities, which is what `KDTrainer`
                         projects (`t_out["distill_backbone"][2:]`).
    - distill_fpn:       the emitted pyramid levels (per `head_strides`)
    - distill_head_cls:  [cls_stem per level] head classification features
    - distill_head_reg:  [reg_stem per level] head regression features

Checkpoints of the two modes share no backbone, fusion or neck state_dict
key (only the detection head's names coincide); `arch_version` (2 = early,
1 = cross_attention) is what keeps one from being loaded as the other — see
`src/training/fusion_modes.py`.
